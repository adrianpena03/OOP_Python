# Given a string str. You are allowed to delete only some contiguous characters if all the characters are the same in a single operation. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to completely delete the string. 

# Examples:

# Input: str = “abcddcba” 

# Output: 4 Delete dd, then the string is “abccba” Delete cc, then the string is “abba” Delete bb, then the string is “aa” Delete aa, then the string is null. 

# Input: str = “abc” 

# Output: 3
